# Forum website
This project is a forum website inspired by platforms like Stack Overflow and Reddit. Users must sign in with Clerk to create a thread and comment. Once signed in, users can edit their own threads, as well as lock or unlock them. Before publishing a thread, users are required to select between two main categories: "Thread" and "QNA.

The behavior of a thread differs between the two categories. For QNA threads, the user can select a comment as the accepted answer, which will automatically lock the thread, preventing further comments. As the forum is still under development, moderators will be added with full access to all threads, allowing them to manage and control any thread.
